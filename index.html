<section>
	Agile software development describes a <u>set of principles</u> for 
	software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through 
	the collaborative effort of <u>self-organizing cross-functional teams</u>. Based 
	off Agile Architecture, it advocates <u>adaptive planning</u>, <u>evolutionary 
	development</u>, <u>early delivery</u>, and <u>continuous improvement</u>, and it encourages 
	rapid and flexible response to change.

		<h3>Agile</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>Formalized in 2001 in the Agile Manifesto</li>

		<h3>Agile Manifesto: Core Values</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
		<li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
		<li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
		<li>Responding to change over following a plan</li>

		<h3>Agile Manifesto: 12 Principles</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.</li>
		<li>2. <u>Welcome changing requirements, even late in development</u>. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.</li>
		<li>3. <u>Deliver working software frequently</u>, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.</li>
		</ul>

	<section>
		<h3>Agile Manifesto: 12 Principles</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.</li>
		<li>5. <u>Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.</u></li>
		<li>6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.</li>

		<li>We use 2 weeks</li>
		<li>At the end of a sprint, a release is done</li>

		<ul>
		<li>Often lots of mystery here, but should not be</li>

		<h3>Grooming</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>Process of refining a story so it is ready to be worked</li>
		<li>Is done by the team</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Though as we do it can often be done by a subset of the team</li>
			</ul>
		<li>It is possible that a story will be groomed multiple times</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Process of refinement, getting additional information</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
	</section>

	<section>
		<ul>
		<li>Ideally happens 2-4 times during a sprint preparing for future sprint</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Though we do once a sprint</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Ideally have 2-3 sprints worth of work groomed at any point in time</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Not end of the world if not</li>
			<li>But both future grooming and planning processes will be much less smooth</li>

	<section>
		<h3>Planning</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>Process of loading a sprint with work</li>
		<li>Is done by the team</li>
		<li>At this point stories potentially going into the sprint should be fully groomed</li>
		<li>Some discussion as to whether tasks are developed here, or before</li>
			<ul>
			<li>We found doing tasks in the planning meeting made for painfully long planning meetings</li>

		<h3>DSU / Daily Standup</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>A quick team catchup</li>
		<li>Every day</li>
		<li>Is attended by the entire team</li>
		<li>Short! 15 minutes</li>

	<section>
		<h3>Demo</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>Just what it sounds like, a demo</li>
		<li>At end of sprint</li>
		<li>Actually showing the result of work done in sprint</li>
		<li>Entire team</li>
		<li>Users / stakeholders, though attendance may vary by content</li>

		<h3>Retro</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>Entire team</li>
		<li>Open discussion of how sprint went, good and bad</li>
		<li>Important to encourage and allow discussion</li>
		<li>Provides input for continual improvement of the process, tailored to the team.</li>

	<section>
		<h3>Testing</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>Not technically part of scrum</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Though is embraced by agile in general</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Doing a release every sprint implies doing regression testing every sprint</li>
		<li>So any level of automated testing is a plus</li>
			<ul>
			<li>But more coverage is better</li>

		<ul>
		<li>Use Scrum</li>
		<li>Learned under a variant called SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)</li>

		<h3>All or Nothing?</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>Do all teams have to be agile/scrum?</li>
		<li>Would be nice, but not required</li>
		<li>Useful to have other teams aware that we use it</li>
