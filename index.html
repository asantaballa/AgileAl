	Agile software development describes a set of principles for 
	software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through 
	the collaborative effort of self-organizing cross-functional teams. Based 
	off Agile Architecture, it advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary 
	development, early delivery, and continuous improvement, and it encourages 
	rapid and flexible response to change.
